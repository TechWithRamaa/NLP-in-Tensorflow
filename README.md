# NLP-in-Tensorflow
Building natural language processing systems using TensorFlow starting from processing text to generating poetry with neural networks (LSTMs)

 * Embarked on a journey into the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by learning how to tokenize words, transforming them into numbers that a machine can understand
 * This foundational knowledge paved the way for understanding how machines can begin to comprehend human language

 * Explored Embeddings
 * These powerful tools map our vocabulary into higher-dimensional space, allowing the machine to grasp the subtleties of word meanings
 * Learned how words with similar sentiments are clustered together, and how the direction of these vectors can reveal the underlying emotions in text
 * The introduction of subword tokenization further enriched your understanding, highlighting the importance of not just the words themselves, but also the sequence in which they appear.
