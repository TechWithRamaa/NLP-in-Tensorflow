# NLP-in-Tensorflow
Building natural language processing systems using TensorFlow starting from processing text to generating poetry with neural networks (LSTMs)

1) https://github.com/TechWithRamaa/NLP-in-Tensorflow/blob/main/Tokenization_Padding_in_Tensorflow.ipynb
   * Embarked on a journey into the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by learning how to tokenize words, transforming them into numbers that a machine can understand
   * This foundational knowledge paved the way for understanding how machines can begin to comprehend human language

2) https://github.com/TechWithRamaa/NLP-in-Tensorflow/blob/main/BBC_News_Articles_Neural_Network_Classifier.ipynb
   * Explored Embeddings
   * These powerful tools map our vocabulary into higher-dimensional space, allowing the machine to grasp the subtleties of word meanings
   * Learned how words with similar sentiments are clustered together, and how the direction of these vectors can reveal the underlying emotions in text
   * The introduction of subword tokenization further enriched your understanding, highlighting the importance of not just the words themselves, but also the sequence in which they appear.

3) https://github.com/TechWithRamaa/NLP-in-Tensorflow/blob/main/Text_Classification_Keras_LSTMs.ipynb
    * Explored various model formats that help capture context (forward & backward), allowing for a more nuanced understanding of sentiment in text
    * This deeper comprehension set the stage for something even more exciting: the ability to predict text
    * Started experimenting with text prediction, laying the groundwork for creating entirely new sequences of words resulting in Poetry

4) https://github.com/TechWithRamaa/NLP-in-Tensorflow/blob/main/Creating_Poetry_With_Bidirectional_LSTMs.ipynb
    * Developed a creative tool by building a poetry generator
    * Drawing inspiration from traditional Irish songs and Shakespearean poetry, you trained your model to generate beautiful verses
